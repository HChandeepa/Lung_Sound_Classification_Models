# PulmoSense AI: Lung Sound Classification using Deep Learning

PulmoSense AI is a comprehensive lung sound classification system designed to identify respiratory conditions (e.g., wheeze, crackle) through deep learning techniques applied to audio signals. This project includes data preprocessing, augmentation, feature extraction, and model development‚Äîculminating in a robust classification pipeline with ensemble learning and inference support.

## üåê Project Overview

Respiratory sound analysis is crucial for early detection of pulmonary diseases. This system leverages modern deep learning and audio signal processing to build an end-to-end classification model trained on curated and preprocessed lung sound data.

## üß† Model Architecture

Three deep learning models were developed and trained:

### 1. **Binary CNN**
- **Purpose**: Classifies whether the lung sound is *normal* or *abnormal*
- **Architecture**: Lightweight convolutional layers with ReLU activations and max pooling
- **Use Case**: Acts as the first-phase screening model

### 2. **CNN (Multiclass)**
- **Purpose**: Performs multiclass classification for *wheeze*, *crackle*, *both*, or *normal*
- **Architecture**: Deep CNN with batch normalization and dropout
- **Advantage**: High precision for spatial feature extraction in lung auscultation data

### 3. **CNN-LSTM (Multiclass)**
- **Purpose**: Multiclass classifier that combines CNN feature extraction with LSTM temporal modeling
- **Architecture**: CNN front-end for spectral features + LSTM layers for sequential patterns
- **Advantage**: Captures both spectral and temporal dependencies in lung sounds

### üîÅ Ensemble Learning
- **Strategy**: Final prediction is generated through hard voting across the three models
- **Benefit**: Improves classification robustness, generalization, and reduces overfitting
